# üëã Hi, I'm Pranav Vijayananth

I'm a freshman at Purdue University majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. Passionate about tech, I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to find efficient solutions in software development, data science, and machine learning. My interests lie in areas like algorithm design, automation, software optimization, and data structures.

Beyond the classroom, I‚Äôve contributed to various projects, ranging from software to make coding accessible for people with disabilities to creating an iOS app using TypeScript and React Native. I‚Äôm also exploring internships to expand my skills in real-world environments.

## üíª Projects I'm Working On

### 1. **Julia Set Generator**
   - **Description**: A function in C (`julia(complex_t arg_z, complex_t arg_c)`) to generate the Julia set, using complex number manipulation. This project has given me deep insights into mathematical modeling and performance optimization.
   - **Tech Stack**: C, Custom `complex_t` structure for complex number operations.

### 2. **Song Management Application**
   - **Description**: A desktop application inspired by Spotify that helps users organize and manage their music collections.
   - **Tech Stack**: Currently exploring frontend and backend development approaches to create a seamless user experience.

### 3. **Wordle Bot**
   - **Description**: A bot that uses information theory to crack the popular Wordle game. This project has been both fun and intellectually stimulating, helping me dive into probability and optimization strategies.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Information Theory.

### 4. **C Program for Dorm Bill Calculation**
   - **Description**: A program that calculates total bills for specific dorms from a data file, using only `fopen()`, `fscanf()`, and `fprintf()` for file handling in C. 
   - **Challenges**: Handling cases where no data matches, and ensuring accurate calculations.

### 5. **Verbal-Assisted IDE for Accessibility**
   - **Description**: A project developed in collaboration with individuals with disabilities, enabling impaired users to code via a verbal-assisted interface powered by AI. Also co-developed a website that translates between verbal programming language and mainstream languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
   - **Tech Stack**: AI, Python, JavaScript.

## üîç What I'm Learning and Exploring

I‚Äôm continually pushing my limits in areas like:
- Logical equivalences, simplifications, and data structure manipulation.
- Building structured data systems, like a bus stop and routes model for city transit.
- Efficient SQL querying and database management for tasks like configuring payloads.
- Advanced Python for web scraping and compatibility troubleshooting.
